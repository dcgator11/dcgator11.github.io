Goal of the game<br>

The goal of War of the Suits is to defeat all of your opponent's core cards (if your opponent's core cards are all discarded but they still have bonus cards in play, the game goes on till all of their bonus cards are defeated. This gives them one last chance to win)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Board setup<br>

The board will have a 3 x 6 layout
At the start a joker is placed in the space closest to each player within the middle column
The first 2 rows in front of each player is their territory no cards except their own can be placed there
The healing spot cannot be attacked
Cards (including the ace) can be forced out of the healing spot if there are no cards left in the players core card deck that can be placed
If your deck has one joker card, ignore the joker board setup rule, the joker now goes in the middle of the board, use an outside method to decide who gets the card<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Important other things<br>

Fortify: allows a card to take a hit without losing any health<br>

Strengthen: doubles a cards damage<br>

Healing spot: An area for a core or bonus ace card, heals other cards that are in it (every turn, a harmed card heals 2 points of health) An unharmed card can be placed within the healing spot. Multiple cards can be in the healing spot.<br>

In the first 2 turns, no cards can be placed, only the joker cards can move, unless the deck only has one joker<br>

Combos can be placed in the healing spot<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
