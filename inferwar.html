    <p>	In a distant universe… On a planet known as Sphaerea, there lies a continent known as Terrena, where we will spend this tale… Terrena is split, via environments and nations; great frozen wastes to the north, a desert in the west that is bent around a lush forest spanning the center, and in the east, a land twisted by magicks and covered in a purple haze…</p>
    <p>A great threat lies seeded into the west however… A fiery hell that is beginning to be unleashed, a threat unlike any before, one that is ancient, and hellbent on conquering all of Terrena. Following their sacred <em>Pyreburner</em>, they plan to destroy all that is, and release their god to help them take over Sphaerea…</p>

    <p>Some nations are miniscule in size, only owning one city or town. <em>Immortalis</em> is one of these tiny civilizations, and here is where we see <em>Mythris.</em><br>
      “May I have a week off of duty sir?” Mythris had asked expectantly.<br>
      “Yes, but please be hasty with your return.” Mythril had responded sternly.<br>
      “Thank you, sir. I will ensure my return is swift.”<br>
      “Please leave my office before I change my mind.”<br>
      “Yes sir! Goodbye, sir.” Mythris had said as she left the commander’s office, and entered Central Immortalis.</p>
    <p>She had raced back home, for she did not want to appear on duty. A few hours had passed since Mythris had her vacation accepted, and now she enters the bustling marketplace of Immortalis, a section of western Immortalis that is well adorned by mercantile tents, buildings, and stands. Only one of these stands out amongst the many sellers on this street, <em>The Worn Tome</em>, a shop just brimming with magicks and trinkets!</p>
    <p>Though Mythris had not seen the store yet, the place was swarming with people. Chatter and small talk could be heard from miles away, “Hello!” “Do you need any curatives?” “Have a look at my stock!”<br>
    “No, thank you though.” Mythris responded to most of the quick offers, until she saw a sign, “There it is! Time to see Isthetha.” She had muttered to herself.</p>
    <p>A bell chimes as the door opens, “Good afternoon! What would you like today?” a voice had asked from behind the counter.<br>
    “Hey Isthetha!” Mythris responded, ignoring the question.<br>
    “Oh, hi Mythris! How are you today?” said Isthetha.<br>
    “I'm alright, managed to get a week off so I wanted to visit.”<br>
    “Well that is just great, but is there anything you want?”<br>
    “Conver-”<br>
    “Besides conversation, Myth.” Istetha stated to Mythris.<br>
    “I will be looking around for something then.” Mythris responded as she turned towards a section of the shop labeled Books, Tomes, and Grimoires.<br>
    “Searching for a new read?” Istetha asked<br>
    “Might as well, late nights are boring without you Isth, so I need something to keep me company!” Mythris had told Isthetha. <br>
    “Fair enough, maybe I should get a book too! For those lonely nights.”<br>
    “I’ll buy you one then, come look with me!” Mythris requested.<br></p>
    <p>A few hours of looking and talking pass by before Mythris finds a book, “This one looks nice, I think I will get it!” Mythris said while holding a tome.</p>
    <p>“Thats nice, but I still haven't found me something… No matter, I will be back at the counter for when you’re ready to pay.” Isthetha had told Mythris.<br>
    “Ok! But first, would you like to come to my house after you close shop?”<br>
    “Alright, I will!” Isthetha answered Mythris. <br></p>
    <p>Mythris went home shortly after the purchase, her home was far from the Merchant District (Western Immortalis), as she lived in Southern Immortalis, though the distance never stopped her from going to visit Isthetha. When Mythris had arrived back at her house, the sky was blackened by the night, few lanterns still adorned the streets. “I hope Isth did not fall asleep yet, we were supposed to meet here at my house tonight…” Mythris spoke to herself, until a knock came upon her door.<br>
    “Myth! It’s me!”<br>
    “Isth! Come in!”<br></p>
    <p>Some time had passed, and they both fell into slumber, unknowing of the peril about to unfold…</p>
